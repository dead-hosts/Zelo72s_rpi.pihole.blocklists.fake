# Zelo*s "Fake" Blocklist
# --------------------------------------------
#
# Extension list to the multi list: 
#   Blocks fake stores, -news, -science,
#   -streaming, rip-offs, cost traps and co.
#
# It was compiled from numerous sources, 
# my own blacklist and various whitelists.
# To keep the list as small as possible, 
# dead domains are removed regularly.
#
# It is updated daily and is available in
# the following formats:
#   domains, hosts and adblock.
#   See: https://github.com/Zelo72

# Created for purely personal, private use.
# Keep the internet clean!

# About Dead-hosts

[Dead-Hosts](https://github.com/dead-hosts) is the replacement of the original idea behind [funilrys/dead-hosts](https://github.com/funilrys/dead-hosts).
Indeed, the idea was to test - with the help of PyFunceble and Travis CI - hosts file, list of domains or even bocklist to have a list of only active domains or IP.

Today, we provide our infrastructure for anybody who want it. [Just ask](https://github.com/dead-hosts/dev-center/issues/new?template=inclusion-request.md)!
